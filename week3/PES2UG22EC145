###Program 1
Statement: Convert a 32-bit value from Little Endian to Big Endian format using RISC-V assembly

###Name of the file
week3a.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
*The main observation is that the byte sequence is reversed. The LSB in Little Endian becomes the MSB in Big Endian and vice versa.
*The number of bytes remains the same during the conversion, only their positions are swapped.
*Here it involves bit-level extraction (masking) and shifting to rearrange the bytes,
but the actual value of individual bytes does not changeâ€”only their order does.
